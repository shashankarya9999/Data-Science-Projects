Welcome to my Data Science repository! 

This repository contains a collection of data science projects which I did during the IBM Data Science Professional certification programme. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data science, data analysis, data visualization and machine learning. 

Stay tuned for more as I will be putting more of my works in this repository in the future!
